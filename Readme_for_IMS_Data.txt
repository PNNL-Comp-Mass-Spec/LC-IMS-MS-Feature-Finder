This feature finder is designed for IMS data, 
including finding LC-MS features and conformers.

A features file is created by clustering together isotopic profiles that are
believed to be from the same isotopic signature eluting over a period of time.
Each feature in the file has representative mass, elution time, drift time and
charge state values that define the feature.
